# Unleashed UWP Mod Manager (USMM)

> A C++/DirectX 11 remake of [momo-AUX1/USMM](https://github.com/momo-AUX1/USMM)'s custom Unleashed mod manager, but with improvements, such as proper UI, fonts, configuration, and tabs.

 **Heads-up:** This project currently uses **Win32 APIs** for windowing, input, and file dialogs. That makes it **Windows Desktop only** right now. If you are any developer wanting to port this to UWP Platform, please take this in mind!

* **this does not support controllers yet.**
* **Not UWP compatible**: uses Win32 (CreateWindowEx, WndProc, common dialogs, etc.)
* **this was horribly coded....:(**
